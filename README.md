# Buyback System

## Overview
The Ikigai Protocol implements an advanced automated buyback system with dynamic pressure mechanics and strategic token burns, enhancing token value and market stability.

## Core Mechanics

### Revenue Collection
| Source | Allocation | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Trading Fees | 30% | From all trading activity |
| NFT Sales | 35% | Primary and secondary sales |
| Treasury Yield | 25% | From treasury investments |
| Transfer Tax | 2-5% | Tiered based on amount |
| Staking Fees | 25% | From staking operations |

### Distribution
- **90% Burn Rate**: Increased burn ratio for stronger deflation
- **10% Rewards**: Reduced rewards allocation
- **30% Reserve**: Long-term stability buffer
- **10% Bull Market**: Reserved for above $1.00 buybacks

### Safety Parameters
```solidity
struct SafetyLimits {
    uint256 cooldown: 12 hours,        // Reduced cooldown
    uint256 emergencyThreshold: 20%,   // Price drop trigger
    uint256 minLiquidity: 1%,          // Of market cap
    uint256 maxImpact: 2%,            // Per depth level
    uint256 depthRatio: 50%           // Minimum required
}
```

### Transfer Tax Tiers
| Amount | Tax Rate |
|--------|----------|
| <100K  | 2% |
| 100K-500K | 3% |
| >500K | 5% |

## Smart Execution
