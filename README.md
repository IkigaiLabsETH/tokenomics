  royaltyBps: 500, // 5% royalties
  defaultAdmin: MULTISIG_ADDRESS,
  buybackEngine: BUYBACK_ENGINE_ADDRESS,
  ikigaiToken: IKIGAI_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  treasuryAddress: TREASURY_ADDRESS,
  defaultCreator: CREATOR_ADDRESS
}
```

## NFT and Token Interaction Flow

The following diagram illustrates how NFT sales contribute to the token buyback and burn mechanism:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Collector] -->|Buys NFT with IKIGAI tokens| B[IkigaiNFT Contract]

    G -->|Reduces supply| I[Increased Scarcity]
    H -->|Distributed to| J[Stakers]
    
    I -->|Potential value increase| K[IKIGAI Token]
    J -->|Incentivizes holding| K
    
    subgraph "Value Flow"
        K -->|Used for purchases| A
    end
```

### Process Explanation

1. **Purchase**: Collectors spend IKIGAI tokens to purchase NFTs
2. **Revenue Split**: The NFT contract distributes the payment:
   - 35% to Buyback Engine
   - 50% to NFT Creator
   - 15% to Treasury
3. **Buyback**: The Buyback Engine uses its share to purchase IKIGAI from the market
4. **Token Allocation**: Of the tokens purchased through buyback:
   - 90% are permanently burned
   - 10% go to the staking rewards pool
5. **Economic Effects**:
   - Supply reduction through burns increases scarcity
   - Staking rewards incentivize long-term holding
   - Creator payments support the NFT ecosystem
   - Treasury funding ensures protocol development

This creates a virtuous cycle where NFT activity directly contributes to token value through systematic reduction in circulating supply, while maintaining incentives for all ecosystem participants.

# Genesis NFT Collection

## GenesisNFT Contract

The GenesisNFT contract is the initial NFT collection that accepts BERA tokens for minting and rewards users with vested IKIGAI tokens, creating the foundation for the Ikigai ecosystem.

### Key Features

#### Tiered Pricing Structure
- **BERA Holder Tier**: Discounted price for BeraChain NFT holders
- **Whitelist Tier**: Standard whitelist price
- **Public Tier**: Regular public sale price

#### Phased Sale Process
```solidity
enum SalePhase { NotStarted, BeraHolders, Whitelist, Public, Ended }
```

- Sequential sale phases with priority access
- Automatic price determination based on user status
- Phase-specific access controls

#### Revenue Distribution
| Allocation | Percentage | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Treasury | 60% | Funds protocol development and operations |
| Rewards | 40% | Converted to IKIGAI tokens for minters |

#### Vested Rewards
```solidity
uint256 public constant VESTING_DURATION = 90 days;
uint256 public constant VESTING_CLIFF = 7 days;
```

- Linear vesting schedule after cliff period
- Automatic reward tracking per user
- Claim function for vested tokens

### Integration Flow

1. **Mint Process**
   - User pays in BERA tokens
   - System checks whitelist status and determines price
   - NFT is minted to user
   - BERA payment is split between treasury and rewards

2. **Reward Conversion**
   - 40% of BERA payment is converted to IKIGAI rewards
   - Conversion rate determined by protocol parameters
   - Rewards are recorded for vesting

3. **Vesting Schedule**
   - 7-day cliff before rewards begin vesting
   - Linear vesting over 90 days total
   - Users can claim vested tokens at any time

### Whitelist Management
```solidity
function updateWhitelist(
    address[] calldata _users,
    bool[] calldata _beraHolderStatus,
    bool[] calldata _generalStatus
) external;
```

- Batch whitelist updates for efficiency
- Separate tracking for BERA holders and general whitelist
- Priority pricing for BERA holders

### Security Features
- ReentrancyGuard protection
- Role-based access control
- Protected reward tokens
- Emergency recovery functions

## Genesis to Regular NFT Transition

The protocol implements a two-phase NFT strategy:

1. **Genesis Phase**
   - Mint with BERA tokens
   - Receive vested IKIGAI rewards
   - Priority access for BeraChain NFT holders
   - Limited collection size

2. **Regular Phase**
   - Mint with IKIGAI tokens
   - 35% to buyback (90% burned, 10% to rewards)
   - 50% to creators
   - 15% to treasury
   - Unlimited collections

This transition creates a virtuous cycle where:
- Initial minters are rewarded with IKIGAI tokens
- These tokens can be used for future NFT mints
- A portion of these tokens are then burned through the buyback system
- The resulting token scarcity benefits early participants

# Advanced Tokenomics Features

## Dynamic Tokenomics System

The IKIGAI protocol implements a sophisticated tokenomics system designed for long-term sustainability, user engagement, and value accrual:

### 1. Referral System with Token Incentives

```solidity
mapping(address => address) public referrers;
mapping(address => uint256) public referralRewards;
uint256 public referralRewardBps = 500; // 5% of mint price

function mintWithReferral(uint256 _quantity, address _referrer) external {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

- 5% of mint price rewarded to referrers
- Automatic tracking of referral relationships
- Claimable rewards for community advocates
- Creates viral growth incentives

### 2. Cross-Collection NFT Synergies

```solidity
function getCollectionBonus(address _user) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 collections = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < registeredCollections.length; i++) {
        if (IERC721(registeredCollections[i]).balanceOf(_user) > 0) {
            collections++;
        }
    }
    
    uint256 bonus = collections * collectionBonusBps;
    return bonus > maxCollectionBonus ? maxCollectionBonus : bonus;
}
```

- 2.5% discount per additional collection owned
- Up to 10% maximum collection bonus
- Encourages ecosystem-wide collecting
- Rewards dedicated community members

### 3. Protocol-Owned NFT Vault

```solidity
// Revenue sharing
uint256 public constant BUYBACK_SHARE_BPS = 2000; // 20% to buyback
uint256 public constant TREASURY_SHARE_BPS = 8000; // 80% to treasury
```

- Protocol acquires and holds strategic NFTs
- 20% of NFT sale revenue to buyback and burn
- 80% to treasury for protocol development
- Creates sustainable protocol-owned assets

### 4. Governance-Weighted Staking

```solidity
function getVotingPower(address _user) external view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) = getUserStakeInfo(_user);
    // Voting power increases with stake amount and duration
    return amount * (lockDuration / 30 days) / 4; // Max 4x multiplier
}
```

- Voting power proportional to stake size and duration
- Aligns governance influence with economic commitment
- Encourages longer staking periods
- Protects protocol from governance attacks

### 5. Milestone-Based Token Unlocks

```solidity
struct Milestone {
    string description;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    bool achieved;
    uint256 unlockTime;
}
```

- Transparent roadmap-based token releases
- 30-day delay between achievement and unlocking
- Governance-controlled milestone verification
- Aligns token release with development progress

### 6. Adaptive Fee Structure

```solidity
function calculateDynamicFee(uint256 _transactionValue) public view returns (uint256) {
    // Base fee for standard transactions
    uint256 fee = baseFee;
    
    // Reduce fee for large transactions
    if (_transactionValue > 10000e18) { // > 10,000 tokens
        fee = fee * 90 / 100; // 10% discount
    }
    
    // Further reduce for very large transactions
    if (_transactionValue > 100000e18) { // > 100,000 tokens
        fee = fee * 80 / 100; // Additional 20% discount
    }
    
    return fee;
}
```

- Base fee: 3% for standard transactions
- Volume discounts for larger transactions:
  - 10% discount for transactions > 10,000 IKIGAI
  - Additional 20% discount for transactions > 100,000 IKIGAI
- Minimum fee: 1%
- Maximum fee: 5%

## Tokenomics Integration Flow

The advanced tokenomics features create a virtuous cycle:

1. **Genesis Phase**
   - Users mint with BERA tokens
   - Receive vested IKIGAI rewards
   - Refer friends for additional rewards

2. **Engagement Phase**
   - Stake IKIGAI for governance rights and discounts
   - Collect across multiple NFT collections for bonuses
   - Participate in milestone achievements

3. **Value Accrual Phase**
   - NFT sales drive buyback and burn
   - Protocol acquires strategic NFTs
   - Treasury grows through adaptive fees
   - Token supply decreases through burns

This integrated system creates multiple reinforcing loops that drive token value, user engagement, and protocol sustainability.
